## 💡 Project Idea
The Epilepsy-Safe Screen Analyzer is a real-time software solution that detects and mitigates visual triggers in video games to protect players with photosensitive epilepsy. By analyzing flicker frequencies (3–60Hz), high-contrast flashes, and color oscillations, it applies GPU-accelerated adjustments (dimming, blurring, desaturation) to reduce seizure risks—without requiring modifications to the game itself.
## ✨ Key Features
- 🔍 Feature 1:  Real-Time Flicker Detection
- ⚡ Feature 2: Dynamic Brightness Control 
- 🛡️ Feature 3: DirectX Overlay with Gaussian Blur
